# Idea - Experiment building easy to use centralized databases of HAM radio information that can be quickly and easily used in any website

Like many computer programmers I think having some centralized databases that many websites (e.g. club, section, division, and specialty websites) can pull information from would be a great thing for many reasons (here are three).  1: It would enable people who want to list relevant repeaters, NETs, in person events, clubs, equipment for sale, etc.  2: It would make it easier for people wanting to display this information.  3: It would be fun. There are several places where these centralized databases can be hosted for free.
